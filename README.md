# McCune-Reischauer-Converter
https://mccune-reischauer.netlify.app/

This tool converts Korean writing into alphabetical letters according to the McCune-Reischauer romanization system (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCune%E2%80%93Reischauer).
The converter makes use of the Hangul.js module in order to deconstruct the syllable blocks. After deconstruction, the Hangul letters are converted into alphabetical letters, 
according to their respective position within the word.
